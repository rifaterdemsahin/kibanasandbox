# PoC: Kibana and ElasticSearch Installation on DigitalOcean

This repository is created to demonstrate a Proof of Concept (PoC) for installing Kibana and ElasticSearch on a DigitalOcean droplet. The setup is automated using Terraform, and the necessary steps to complete this PoC are outlined below.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. **Terraform** installed on your local machine.
2. A **DigitalOcean** account and API token.
3. **SSH keys** for accessing your DigitalOcean droplets.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kibana-elasticsearch-poc.git
cd kibana-elasticsearch-poc
```

### 2. Create Your Terraform Variables File (`terraform.tfvars`)

You will need to create a `terraform.tfvars` file to store your DigitalOcean API token and other variables. Below is an example of what the file might look like:

```hcl
# terraform.tfvars
do_token      = "your_digitalocean_api_token"
region        = "nyc3" # or any other DigitalOcean region
ssh_key_ids   = ["your_ssh_key_id"] # replace with your actual SSH key ID
droplet_size  = "s-1vcpu-1gb" # choose your preferred droplet size
```

### 3. Add Your SSH Keys

Ensure that your SSH keys are added to the `ssh_keys` block in the Terraform configuration, so you can SSH into the droplet after it's created.

### 4. Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

### 5. Apply the Terraform Configuration

Run the following command to create the infrastructure on DigitalOcean:

```bash
terraform apply
```

This command will prompt you to confirm the changes. Type `yes` to proceed.

### 6. Access Kibana and ElasticSearch

Once the infrastructure is up and running, you can access Kibana and ElasticSearch via the public IP address of your DigitalOcean droplet.

## Cleanup

When you're done with the PoC, you can destroy the created infrastructure using:

```bash
terraform destroy
```
