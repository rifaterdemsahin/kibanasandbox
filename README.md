# PoC: Kibana and ElasticSearch Installation on DigitalOcean

This repository is created to demonstrate a Proof of Concept (PoC) for installing Kibana and ElasticSearch on a DigitalOcean droplet. The setup is automated using Terraform, and the necessary steps to complete this PoC are outlined below.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. **Terraform** installed on your local machine.
2. A **DigitalOcean** account and API token.
3. **SSH keys** for accessing your DigitalOcean droplets.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kibana-elasticsearch-poc.git
cd kibana-elasticsearch-poc
```

### 2. Create Your Terraform Variables File (`terraform.tfvars`)

You will need to create a `terraform.tfvars` file to store your DigitalOcean API token and other variables. Below is an example of what the file might look like. **Do not use the values shown here directly; replace them with your own.**

```hcl
# terraform.tfvars
do_token      = "your_digitalocean_api_token"
region        = "your_preferred_region" # e.g., nyc3, lon1, etc.
droplet_size  = "your_droplet_size" # e.g., s-1vcpu-1gb, s-1vcpu-2gb, etc.
node_count    = 1 # Number of Kibana nodes
ssh_key_id    = "your_ssh_key_id" # replace with your actual SSH key ID
public_ip     = "your_public_ip/32" # replace with your public IP
```

**Note:** Keep your `terraform.tfvars` file secure and do not share it publicly.

### 3. Add Your SSH Keys

Ensure that your SSH keys are added to the `ssh_keys` block in the Terraform configuration so you can SSH into the droplet after it's created.

### 4. Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

### 5. Apply the Terraform Configuration

Run the following command to create the infrastructure on DigitalOcean:

```bash
terraform apply
```

This command will prompt you to confirm the changes. Type `yes` to proceed.

### 6. Access Kibana and ElasticSearch

Once the infrastructure is up and running, you can access Kibana and ElasticSearch via the public IP address of your DigitalOcean droplet.

## Cleanup

When you're done with the PoC, you can destroy the created infrastructure using:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Thank you for checking out this PoC! Happy coding! ðŸš€
```

### Instructions:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Replace the placeholders like `https://github.com/yourusername/kibana-elasticsearch-poc.git` with the actual repository URL.
2. **Fill in your DigitalOcean API token and SSH key ID**: Replace the placeholders in `terraform.tfvars` with your actual values, but keep the file secure.

This README update ensures sensitive information like your API token and SSH key are not exposed while guiding users through setting up the PoC.
